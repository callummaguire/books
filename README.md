## Reading Engineering books 

I believe in the advice that Uncle Bob gives in his book, Clean Coder, that engineers should spend an extra three hours a day to push their knowledge. I spend a lot of time reading engineering books, and I think that summarizing what I've learned while reading can solidify my understanding. For this reason, I have created a public Github repository where anyone can see my personal opinions about engineering books and the lessons I've learned.
