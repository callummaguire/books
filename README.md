## Reading Engineering books 

I believe in the advice that uncle bob gives in the book (clean coder) that engineer should spend a extra 3 hours a day to push their knowledge. I spend a lot of time reading engineering books, and I believe that summarizing what I've learned while reading can solidify my understanding. For this reason, I have created a public Github repository where anyone can see my personal opinions about the engineering books and lesson learnt.
